BY FRIDAY NIGHT ALL THIS IS DONE


Notes from working through model with Mike:
- DONE Improve fuselage weight
- Improve tail weights (Use JHO model with more plies)
- Look at efficiencies in electrical system
- Skin friction fuselage drag from Solidworks area input
- fix CD in climb to be the total CD of the aircraft, not just blown wing
- bring up the charge in flight versus charge on ground tradeoff in infrastructure
- seperate battery charge power into P_charge variable
- Implement Alan's fits for Powertrain
- Look at why propeller radius is not huge, filling maximum space
- If landing constrained, why powered wheels? Because RPM constrained to mass, fix that
- Fix Wcent to only be the central masses, not including the wing
- Impose constraint on capspar thickness and width to be the same throughout sections (no taper)
- Increase minimum gauge of wing skin by multiplying the current thickness
- Feed fuselage width into span usability for number of props
- Add back in the mu*CLg constraint to B for takeoff to be more optimistic
- Implement Breguet range for cruise
- Use raymer A and B eqns for landing, make sure to use a different fit appropriate for landing
- Add climb to altitude range to total range
- Change Sclimb to reflect steeper angle (20 degrees)
- Why is u_j zero in cruise?
- Figure out how to get no changes from sol.txt with commits
- Figure out why u_j is less than flight velocity
- Get electric going again
- Add baggage

Priorities:
Hammer these down
- Hybrid (started, very low mass)
- Powered wheels (favourable atm, getting higher takeoff mass without them)
- weights and drag cleanup, integrate sheet ()
- Tails weight and drag
- Raymer landing model include

Solution anal
- Look at fstruct sensitivitycda
- Check g-loading on wing
- Check sensitivity to Pstar for Powertrain
- check sensitivity of Wing/mfac
